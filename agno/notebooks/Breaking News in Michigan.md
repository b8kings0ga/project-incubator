*Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has launched a new online tracking system to inform residents about federal actions and their impact on Michigan.*

### Breaking Story

LANSING, MI - Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has escalated efforts to confront Trump Administration policies by unveiling a new "Federal Actions Tracker" designed to keep Michiganders informed about ongoing legal battles between the state and federal government.

Launched on the Department of Attorney General's website, the tracker details lawsuits and legal briefs filed in response to federal policies that Nessel argues are "unlawful and damaging to Michigan residents."

"Left unchallenged, Donald Trump's unlawful actions would have grave consequences for Michigan," said Nessel in a public statement. "Michiganders deserve to know how these illegal federal actions affect their lives."

### Key Details

Since the start of the new Trump Administration term, Nessel's office has filed 10 lawsuits and joined 17 amicus briefs nationwide to oppose federal policies that she contends infringe on the rights of Michigan residents. Among the major issues prompting legal action are:

- Interruptions to Social Security services
- Environmental rollbacks
- Immigration-related enforcement orders

The tracker outlines several prominent lawsuits, including:

1. **New Jersey et al. v. Trump**: Filed to stop an executive order that would deny birthright citizenship to some U.S.-born children
2. **New York et al. v. Trump**: Challenges the pause on federal disbursements
3. **Massachusetts v. NIH**: Co-led by Michigan, this lawsuit opposes cuts to NIH-funded medical research that could cost the University of Michigan $181 million and affect over 425 clinical trials
4. **New Mexico et al. v. Musk**: Contests Elon Musk's appointment to federal executive authority
5. **California et al. v. Trump, Bondi et al.**: Filed to block Executive Order No. 14248 on voter ID laws

### Local Impact

In an unusually public-facing legal campaign, Attorney General Nessel has been touring cities across Michigan to hear from residents firsthand. Town halls have already been held in Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Plymouth, Detroit, Kalamazoo, Benton Harbor, and Flint Township, with additional events scheduled in Lansing, Southfield, and Roseville.

The AG has also launched a dedicated reporting form for Michiganders experiencing difficulties accessing federal benefits or services, particularly focusing on Social Security access. This data could fuel further legal action.

## ðŸ¦  MEASLES ALERT ISSUED IN MID-MICHIGAN AFTER RESTAURANT EXPOSURES

![Measles Virus](https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/3BSIOTRRMFDPVBH6AZPKTHCHUQ.jpg?_a=DATAdtccZAA0)

*Health officials are warning about potential measles exposures at restaurants in Lansing and Orion Township.*

### Breaking Story

LANSING, MI - The Barry-Eaton District Health Department (BEDHD) is urgently investigating a possible measles case in an Eaton County resident, issuing a public alert on April 18 to notify individuals who may have been exposed at two separate restaurants.

With test results pending, BEDHD Medical Director Dr. Julie Kehdi emphasized the importance of rapid public communication and preventive steps, particularly as measles is highly contagious, even before symptoms appear.

"We are acting out of an abundance of caution to notify the public as quickly as possible," said Dr. Kehdi. "Measles spreads easily and can have serious health consequences, especially for children and people with weakened immune systems."

### Potential Exposure Locations

Anyone who visited the following locations during the specified time windows may have been exposed:

- **April 12, 2025** - King Ocean Crab, Miller St., Lansing, MI - 6:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
- **April 13, 2025** - Bad Brads BBQ, S. Baldwin Rd., Orion Township, MI - 4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

These sites span Eaton and Oakland counties, signaling a possible spread risk across different parts of the state.

### What To Do If Exposed

For individuals exposed on April 13, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is available until Saturday, April 19. PEP options may include MMR vaccination or immune globulin, depending on age and health status.

Measles symptoms can begin 7 to 14 days after exposure and may include:
- Fever
- Cough
- Runny nose
- Red eyes
- A distinct red rash, typically appearing several days after other symptoms

People are considered contagious four days before and four days after the appearance of the rash, which makes early detection and self-isolation essential.

### Vaccination Concerns

Although measles is vaccine-preventable, outbreaks still occur, largely due to declines in vaccination rates. According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, MMR vaccine coverage among kindergartners dropped to 88.5% in 2023, below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity.

Health experts continue to stress that the two-dose MMR vaccine is 97% effective and remains the best defense against the disease.
